# Choose a Skyp Yard
A web application for renting Sky Yards, providing users with an intuitive platform to browse, book, and manage yard rentals.

## Description
On this page, users can choose the Sky Yard that best fits their needs, based on availability, size, and features.

## Features
- Updated the information layout inside the container:
  - **Capacity** is now displayed in a different position and shown only once, as it’s sufficient.
  - **Price** and **rental duration** are centered and styled with a new design.
  - The **"Apply for Order"** button was modified — including form, color, and text.
  - The **image** now has a clearer border/frame for better visual presentation.

- When selecting a container:
  - The border of the selected container becomes more solid and changes color.
  - Only the button of the selected container is updated, with new text and a different style.
  - A bar appears at the bottom of the page showing details about the selected container (price, capacity, and rental days):
    - The bottom bar has a redesigned look, making it easier for users to read and better understand what they are renting, including the total price and rental conditions.
    - The bottom bar also includes two buttons: one to go to the next page and one to go back.

- The colors and layout of the entire page have been updated.
